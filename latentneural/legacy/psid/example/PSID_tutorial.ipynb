        "`nx` determines the total dimension of the latent state and `n1` determines how many of those dimensions will be priorotizing the inclusion of behaviorally relevant neural dynamcis (i.e. will be extracted using stage 1 of PSID). So the values that you would select for these hyperparameters depend on the goal of modeling and on the data. Some examples use cases are:\n",
        "- If you want to perform dimension reduction, `nx` will be your desired target dimension. For example, to reduce dimension to 2 to plot low-dimensional visualizations of neural activity, you would use `nx=2`. Now if you want to reduce dimension while preservising as much behaviorally relevant neural dynamics as possible, you would use `n1=nx`. \n",
        "- If you want to find the best fit to data overall, you can perform a grid search over values of `nx` and `n1` and pick the value that achieves the best performance metric in the training data. For exmaple, you could pick the `nx` and `n1` pair that achieves the best cross-validated behavior decoding in an inner-cross-validation within the training data.\n",

        "# How to pick the horizon `i`?\n",
        "The horizon `i` does not affect the model structure and only affects the intermediate linear algebra operations that PSID performs during the learning of the model. Nevertheless, different values of `i` may have different model learning performance. `i` needs to be at least 2, but also also determines the maximum `n1` and `nx` that can be used per: \n",

        "n1 <= nz * i\n",
        "nx <= ny * i\n",
        "```\n",
        "So if you have a low dimensional y or z, you typically would choose larger values for `i`, and vice versa. It is also possible to select the best performing `i` via an inner cross-validation approach similar to `nx` and `n1` above."
